Chaning for tests:
   Define the player types (X is defined on line 22 in SuperTicTacToe.cpp) (O is defined on line 44 in SuperTicTacToe.cpp). The options, as the second parameter, are USER,RANDOM, or TREE

   Change Driver.cpp, by commenting out sttt.play() and uncommenting the play 100 code to have a computer play against itself 100 times. Otherwise it will play one game.

   You can change the depth of the negamax tree on line 121 in SuperTicTacToe.cpp 

   Finally you can change the number of processors on line 15 in minimax.cpp

To compile:
   simply type "make"

To run:
   simply type "./player.out" 

You can also combine the compile and run steps by typing "make run"
